## configuration and evaluation scores
See [evaluation_scores.csv](https://github.com/UKPLab/on-emergence/blob/main/evaluation_scores.csv) for the configurations and evaluation scores of our experiments.

## output files
All of the output files associated to our experiments can be found [here](https://tudatalib.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/handle/tudatalib/3931). We name each file in a **date_time** fashion (e.g., ```results-20230524_123238.json```), which is also the ```run_id``` of an experiment that can be found in [evaluation_scores.csv](https://github.com/UKPLab/on-emergence/blob/main/evaluation_scores.csv).
